Play2pdf module
===================

## Notice

* The [original project](https://github.com/joergviola/play20-pdf) by @joergviola was declared unsupported on January 17, 2014
* The most active fork (aside from this one) seems to be https://github.com/fhars/play20-pdf

This module helps generating PDF documents dynamically from your Play! web application.
It simply renders your HTML- and CSS-based templates to PDF.
It is based on the Flying Saucer library, which in turn uses iText for PDF generation.

Usage
-----

I have provided a simple example application at
https://github.com/takachino/play2pdf/samples/pdf-sample

You can use a standard Play! scala template like this one:
``` html
	@(message: String)

	Image: <img src="/public/images/favicon.png"/><br/>
	Hello world! <br/>
	@message <br/>
```

Then this template, after having imported ```util.pdf.PDF```, can simply be rendered as:
``` java
	public static Result document() {
		return PDF.ok(document.render("Your new application is ready."));
	}
```
where ```PDF.ok``` is a simple shorthand notation for:
``` java
	ok(PDF.toBytes(document.render("Your new application is ready."))).as("application/pdf")
```

Template rules
--------------

Templates must generate XHTML.

If the template is using an image, stylesheet, etc., it usually is loaded via an http call.
The PDF modules tries to optimize that resource loading:
If you specify the URI as a path into the classpath of your Play! app, the resource is loaded directly instead.
See the above sample template for an example.

Of course you can link to CSS files in your class path also, but be aware not to
use the `media="screen"` qualifier.

Fonts you use must be explicitly packaged with your app.
```
<html>
	<head>
		<style type="text/css"><!--
		body {
			...
			font-family: FreeSans;
		}
		--></style>
	</head>
	<body>
		...
	</body>
</html>
```

Since the FreeSans font is not available to the java VM, you are required to
add the corresponding font file, "FreeSans.ttf" to your Play! app.
The module adds ```/conf/resources/fonts``` to the list of directories
searched for font files.

Installation
------------

Currently, the module is hosted at http://takachino.github.io/play2pdf/snapshots/
Therefore, including the following lines in your ```Build.scala``` will resolve it:
```
val appDependencies = Seq(
  ...
      "de.joergviola" %% "play2pdf_2.10" % "0.6.3-SNAPSHOT"
)
val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
  ...
  resolvers += Resolver.url("play2pdf Repository", url("http://takachino.github.io/play2pdf/snapshots/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
)
```
After the next restart of Play!, the module is available.
If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, remember to re-generate your project files.

(Note: This might not work..) The module can be loaded (sbt v13.0+)  in your build.sbt via git
```
lazy val myProject = project.in(file("."))
    .aggregate(play2pdf)
    .dependsOn(play2pdf)
lazy val play2pdf = ProjectRef( uri("https://github.com/alias1/play2pdf.git"), "play2pdf")
```
After the next restart of Play!, the module is available.
If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, remember to re-generate your project files.
